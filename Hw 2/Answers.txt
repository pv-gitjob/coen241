5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions? (4 pts)
For “curl”, change the string data that follows “-d”, and the input format
“content-type” after “-H” if needed. For “faas-cli”, change the echo that is being
piped.

6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs? (4 pts)
Edit “handler.py” for the slack-interactive function by adding some “if” statements
based on the response variable and return different “data” for each condition,
then redeploy the function.
